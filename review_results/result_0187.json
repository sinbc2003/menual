    "verdict": "PASS",
    "reason": "Question is clear and specific. Answer correctly states 13:00 기준 for 반일연가, matches source text from page 309 line 22. Additional context about 공휴일/토요일 is from same page. No hallucination."

    "reason": "Hallucination. Answer contains fabricated example calculations (사례: 병가 3일, 5일, 15일, 10일 = 41일) not found in source text or page 309 markdown. Source only states the 30-day rule; the specific numerical examples are invented."

    "id": "q_4_0999",
    "verdict": "FAIL",
    "reason": "Massive hallucination. Source text is one sentence about 교육장 approval. Answer fabricates extensive NAIS system procedures (기본메뉴, 복무, 개인근무상황관리, 결재자 지정, 공람함, 메시지함 etc.) none of which appear in page 309 source."

  {
    "id": "q_4_1000",
    "verdict": "FAIL",
    "reason": "Hallucination of fabricated examples (사례1, 사례2 with specific day-by-day calculations). Also contains unsourced claim '반일연가 2회 = 연가 1일'. Near-duplicate topic with q_4_0993 from batch 0186."
