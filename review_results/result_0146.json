    "id": "q_4_0133",
    "verdict": "PASS",
    "reason": "Good question about vacation attendance obligation. Answer correctly synthesizes sources from pages 262 (휴업일 복무) and 263 (방학 중 근무). Source texts verified against markdown files."
  },
  {
    "id": "q_4_0134",
    "verdict": "PASS",
    "reason": "Meaningful question about grad school during work hours. Answer covers conditions, night/seasonal programs, overtime pay, and leave limits all supported by page 263 source."
  },
  {
    "id": "q_4_0136",
    "verdict": "PASS",
    "reason": "Distinct question specifically about daytime grad school. Concise, well-structured answer. Source text verified on page 263."

  {
    "id": "q_4_0137",
    "verdict": "PASS",
    "reason": "Specific focused question about overtime pay eligibility during grad school. Answer correctly cites the 사례 ruling (교원07000-426). Source text verified on page 263."

  {
    "id": "q_4_0138",
    "verdict": "FAIL",
    "reason": "Duplicate of q_4_0133. Both ask essentially the same question (방학 중 출근 의무) with near-identical meaning; q_4_0138 just adds 교원 to the phrasing."

    "id": "q_4_0139",
    "verdict": "FAIL",
    "reason": "Answer contains hallucinated details not on cited page 263: 공람자 지정 recipients (초등교육지원과, 중등교육지원과) are not found on page 263 or adjacent page 264. Source text is too brief to support the full answer."

  {
    "id": "q_4_0140",
    "verdict": "FAIL",
    "reason": "Answer is a raw dump of the entire page 263 대학원 수강 section. Question asks about 자격 요건 but source has no specific qualification requirements. Duplicate answer with q_4_0141, q_4_0142, q_4_0143."

  {
    "id": "q_4_0142",
    "verdict": "FAIL",

    "verdict": "FAIL",
