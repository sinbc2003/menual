    "verdict": "FAIL",
    "reason": "DUPLICATE_ANSWER with q_4_0458 - identical answer content from same source. Question has grammar error ('범위 및 업무 업무를' duplicates 업무). Question is also vague and generic."

    "verdict": "FAIL",
    "reason": "DUPLICATE_ANSWER with q_4_0458 and q_4_0459 - identical answer and same source. Three entries from same source text with nearly identical answers provide no distinct value."

    "verdict": "PASS",
    "reason": "Answer covers the guideline's purpose, scope, and principles from page 283. Source text verified. Answer extends beyond truncated source.text but all content is on the referenced page. Question is meaningful."

    "id": "q_4_0466",
    "verdict": "FAIL",
    "reason": "DUPLICATE_ANSWER - substantially duplicated from q_4_0461 with same source text. Question asks how the principle is 'actually applied' but answer just lists legal principles without practical application examples. Does not answer the asked question."
