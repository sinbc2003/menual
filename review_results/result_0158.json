    "verdict": "PASS",
    "reason": "Good practical question about when to issue 직무대리 명령서. Answer correctly covers the 15-day rule and exceptions. source.text verified on page 276 line 15. Answer adds related info (한 사람 하나의 직위, 재직무대리 불가, 권한범위) all from page 276."

    "reason": "DUPLICATE_ANSWER with q_4_0342, q_4_0343, q_4_0346. Answer is raw dump of source text (직무대리규정 clauses 2-3). Question asks for 'definition' but answer just pastes regulation text without synthesis. Template-generated question."

    "verdict": "FAIL",
    "reason": "DUPLICATE_ANSWER with q_4_0341-q_4_0343. Question is a raw source text fragment ('항에 따른 바로 아래 공무원이 직무대리를 하는 것이 적당하지 아니하다고 인정되는 경우') used as a question - not a natural user question."

    "verdict": "PASS",
    "reason": "Legitimate question asking what Article 6 (직무대리의 운영) is. Answer provides full text of Article 6-8, all verified on page 276. source.text matches page 276 lines 11-19. Answer extends beyond source.text citation but all content is from same page."
