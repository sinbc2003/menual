    "verdict": "PASS",
    "reason": "Question focuses on 휴가/연수 specifically. Source text from pages 265/267 verified. Answer is well-structured with accurate table and notes about 공람자 지정. Sufficiently distinct from q_4_0189 in focus and detail."

    "verdict": "PASS",

    "verdict": "FAIL",
    "reason": "Broken question grammar: '신청 방법을 신청할 때' is nonsensical (you don't 'apply for an application method'). Answer dumps entire table without addressing the specific question about 유의사항 (precautions). Also beginning of a series of near-identical answers."
