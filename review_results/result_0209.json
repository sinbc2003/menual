    "verdict": "FAIL",
    "reason": "Duplicate answer: identical content to q_4_1346 and q_4_1347. Question asks about period (기간) and frequency (횟수) of maternity leave but answer does not clearly state the 90-day period (that is on page 323) and does not discuss frequency at all."

    "verdict": "FAIL",
    "reason": "Malformed question: '만약 주 이내 유·사산한 경우' is missing a number before 주 (should be '15주', '16주' etc.). The question is nonsensical without specifying the pregnancy week. Duplicate answer content with q_4_1346/q_4_1347/q_4_1348."

    "verdict": "FAIL",
