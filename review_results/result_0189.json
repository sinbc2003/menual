    "reason": "Question is clear and appropriate (asks for a summary of leave precautions). Answer accurately summarizes source.text from page 309 section 4 (휴가실시 등에 있어 유의할 점). Source text verified against 309쪽.md lines 31-42. No hallucination."

    "verdict": "FAIL",
    "reason": "Question asks what new teachers should know specifically, but answer provides no new-teacher-specific information. Duplicate answer of q_4_1030 and q_4_1031."

    "verdict": "FAIL",
    "reason": "Question asks about leave day calculation criteria (휴가일수의 계산의 기준) but the answer mostly contains approval procedure content (승인권자 및 절차) from section 2, ending with only the heading '휴가일수의 계산' without the actual calculation rules. Source.text title/content mismatch."
