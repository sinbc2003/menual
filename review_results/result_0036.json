    "verdict": "FAIL",
    "reason": "DUPLICATE_ANSWER with q_1_0633. Same source.text, identical answer body (only intro sentence differs). Also a raw source dump with no synthesis."

    "reason": "DUPLICATE_ANSWER with q_1_0633 and q_1_0634 (triplicate). Question specifically asks about exceptions/special provisions (특이사항이나 예외 규정) but the answer provides the same generic regulation text without identifying any exceptions."

    "id": "q_1_0637",
    "verdict": "PASS",
    "reason": "Natural question about exchange posting period. Answer accurately states 2 years (non-extendable), conditions, selection priority (4 categories), return assignment rules, and 벽지 가산점 exclusion. All verified against page 45 source. Well-synthesized with table and structured sections."

    "id": "q_1_0638",
    "verdict": "PASS",

    "verdict": "FAIL",
    "reason": "DUPLICATE_QUESTION and DUPLICATE_ANSWER with q_1_0637. Question is nearly identical (얼마나 되나요 vs 얼마인가요) and answer covers the same core content (2년, 연장불가, conditions, 복귀 후 임지, 벽지 가산점)."
