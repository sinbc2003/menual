    "verdict": "FAIL",
    "reason": "Question asks how regulations changed recently (최근에 어떻게 바뀌었나요) but answer only states current rules from page 254 without explaining what changed. Also hallucinated repeated law citation (연수기관 지정에 관한 규칙 listed twice in 관련 법령)."
  },
  {
    "id": "q_3_1172",
    "verdict": "FAIL",
    "reason": "Duplicate answer with q_3_1171. Same page 254 source, nearly identical answer. Question about school admin office tasks (학교 행정실) is not specifically addressed by the answer."

    "reason": "Question asks about impact on teacher careers (교원의 경력에 어떤 영향) but answer only states procedural rules from page 254 without discussing career impact. Source material contains no career-impact information. Question-answer mismatch."
  },
  {
    "id": "q_3_1181",
