    "verdict": "FAIL",
    "reason": "Raw dump of table fragments at top of answer (e.g. '(재직기간 중 총 3년) | 3년 이내'). Question asks about 경력 impact but answer mainly discusses 신분 보유/직무 종사 금지. Poorly formatted table data mixed with narrative content."

    "verdict": "FAIL",
    "reason": "Duplicate of q_3_0144. Same page 126 결원보충 content with nearly identical answer covering the same 11 leave types and 6-month condition. Question is only trivially different ('언제부터' vs '어떤 것들')."
