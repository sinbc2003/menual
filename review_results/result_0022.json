    "verdict": "PASS",
    "reason": "Good question about 원로교사 definition and benefits. Answer accurately synthesizes content from pages 26-27: definition (제9조의6(1)), 우대사항 (제9조의6(2)), 임용 절차 (60일 전 교사임용희망서 제출), 역할 (신규교사 상담, 장학지도, 자문). Source text is a valid substring of page 26 line 41. Natural question with proper synthesis."

Question asks about '조건' but answer dumps everything including appointment authority (1), term length (2), transferability (8), and delegation (9) without distinguishing which are conditions. No reformulation or organization beyond the original numbering."

    "reason": "bad_question: Question asks about '기간과 횟수' (period and count) for 교장 등의 임용, but the source text is from the 나) 교육공무원임용령 제9조의5 section about re-appointment eligibility conditions, not about the primary 기간 (4년, from 가)(2)) or 횟수 (한 번 중임, from 가)(3)). The answer's '주요 수치: 4년' is tangential - the source only mentions '4년 미만' as a condition threshold, not as the primary term length."
