    "reason": "Template question mismatch: asks about '요건' (requirements) for '일반적 관리' but the section covers work rules (공휴일 근무, 출장, 탄력적 근무시간제), not requirements. The question treats a section heading as a procedure."

    "id": "q_4_0101",
    "verdict": "FAIL",
    "reason": "Template question about '처리 기한' (processing deadlines) but source has no deadline information. Also duplicate answer with q_4_0099 (identical content dump from page 261 일반적 관리 section)."

    "verdict": "FAIL",
    "reason": "Subjective template question: asks '가장 중요한 조건' (most important condition) but source does not rank obligations by importance. Answer just lists 품위유지, 정치운동 금지, etc. without addressing the ranking."

    "id": "q_4_0107",
    "verdict": "FAIL",
    "reason": "Question-answer mismatch: asks about '교원의 신분에 미치는 영향' (impact on teacher status) but source text about 일반적 관리 discusses work management rules, not impact on status. Also duplicate answer with q_4_0099."

  {
    "id": "q_4_0108",
    "verdict": "FAIL",
    "reason": "Duplicate answer with q_4_0099/q_4_0107. Question asks for '구체적인 적용 사례' (specific application examples) but answer provides rules, not examples."
